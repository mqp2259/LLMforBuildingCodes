# LLMs for Building Codes

This repository contains the code for an AI-based system capable of answering natural language questions about the National Building Code of Canada.

## Organization

* The `search.py` file implements the experiment to measure the effectiveness of the search algorithms.
* The `generate.py` file implements the experiment to measure the effectiveness of the LLMs. The `likelihood.py` and `similarity.py` files implement the actual calculation of the associated metrics.
* The `data_generator.py` file implements the process used to generate the testing dataset.
* The `embeddings.py` file implements the process used to train a doc2vec-based embeddings model.

Unfortunately, the testing dataset cannot be published due to copyright constraints.
